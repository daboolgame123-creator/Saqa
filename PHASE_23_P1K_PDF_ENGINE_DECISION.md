# ALSQAYA Phase 23 / P1k — PDF engine decision study (2026-11-06)

Status: **PLAN / EXPERIMENTAL; NO PRODUCTION CHANGE**.

## Objective
Choose the simplest defensible Arabic PDF renderer, without enabling the report HTTP endpoints or weakening host security. The existing Chromium test is a reference baseline; its native sandbox fails on current CI (exit 133). Existing PDFKit export also remains a baseline.

## Primary-source research
- Playwright Docker: https://playwright.dev/docs/docker — separate non-root user and a reviewed seccomp profile that permits namespace creation; its published image is primarily a development/test image, not production approval.
- Chromium Ubuntu AppArmor userns: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/apparmor-userns-restrictions.md
- Ubuntu 24.04 release notes: https://documentation.ubuntu.com/release-notes/24.04/ — restricted unprivileged user namespaces; per-binary AppArmor policy is preferable to disabling host-wide restrictions.
- Docker seccomp: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/ — retain a reviewed restrictive policy, never use unconfined or SYS_ADMIN merely to pass a probe.
- WeasyPrint documentation: https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/ — HTML/CSS to PDF, font rendering via Pango/HarfBuzz, no Chromium browser process. Does not mean zero parsing/security risk.

## Candidates and tradeoffs

| Engine | Advantages | Risks / required proof |
|---|---|---|
| Chromium in reviewed sandbox | Already proved synthetic Arabic PDF continuity (85/38), familiar HTML/CSS print | Native sandbox blocked on CI; production browser isolation and updates require review |
| WeasyPrint in isolated worker | No full browser runtime; mature paged-print engine, Pango/HarfBuzz font handling | Separate Python runtime; URL fetcher must forbid network/local file access; Arabic BiDi, long tables, page breaks, fonts and extraction need tests |
| Existing PDFKit | Already integrated in Node; no browser process | Current Arabic visual/BiDi correctness must be compared; layout features differ |

## Decision criteria (must be verified, not assumed)
1. Arabic shaping, mixed Arabic/Latin numbers/dates, copy/search text and logical record order.
2. Complete 85 detail and 38 acknowledgement synthetic records, no duplicates or omissions, bounded page count and visual page-break review.
3. No remote fetches or arbitrary local file reads, restricted fonts and input; process isolation, no writable host mount, time/CPU/memory/PID/output quotas and crash cleanup.
4. Maintain trusted server-side access scoping, fixed template, output size limit and unchanged HTTP 503 gate.
5. Font license, runtime update policy, deployment host feasibility and independent security approval.

## Planned experiment — P1k-ALT-01
**Before implementation:** create a CI-only WeasyPrint probe with pinned package version, synthetic existing HTML fixtures, a URL fetcher that rejects external/local resource access, bounded output and an explicit artifact for extraction/visual comparison. This is not a production dependency or report endpoint. Fail closed if dependency installation or rendering is unavailable; never silently pass. Compare results to the existing Chromium proof. If successful, proceed to a separate production-executor design; otherwise keep Chromium sandbox investigation open.

## Release decision
No renderer is production approved. Do not disable host AppArmor restrictions, grant SYS_ADMIN, enable seccomp=unconfined or expose the report routes. Explicit sign-off and real target-host verification remain required.

## ALT-01 execution and measured result — 2026-11-06

The research and plan above were committed **before implementation** as `aa92a0d9`. The synthetic-only WeasyPrint pilot was added in `c5c2b8e6`, wired into CI in `618b0cd4`, and its fixture-ordering issue corrected in `bb8e7b08`. The first workflow `42134295022` **failed** because the synthetic HTML files were generated later in the pipeline; this was a test setup error, not a PDF rendering defect. The corrected workflow [42134455934](https://github.com/daboolgame123-creator/Saqa/actions/runs/42134455934) **completed SUCCESS**.

**Observed proof from the passing CI job logs:**
- `P1K_WEASYPRINT_CONTINUITY_PASS kind=details records=85 bytes=43814`
- `P1K_WEASYPRINT_CONTINUITY_PASS kind=ack records=38 bytes=22821`

Both PDFs were generated from the same existing synthetic Arabic HTML fixtures as Chromium, and `pdftotext` recovered all numbered records in order with ISO timestamps. WeasyPrint was installed in CI as version `66.0` (not added as a production application dependency). Its URL fetcher rejects all external resources, and PDFs are bounded to 12,000,000 bytes. The existing Chromium and report security workflow tests remained green.

**Decision:** WeasyPrint is a **viable candidate** and warrants a second-stage comparison of visual Arabic shaping, line wraps, pagination, font licenses, dependency supply chain, and isolation under adversarial inputs. This proof does **not** establish comprehensive absence of filesystem access, a complete sandbox, or safe production deployment. Do not replace Chromium or PDFKit yet. Prefer a dedicated isolated WeasyPrint worker if later security and quality checks pass. Keep the Chromium-native sandbox issue recorded as unresolved rather than weakening the host. Reports remain HTTP 503.

**Next plan-first checkpoint:** visual side-by-side PDF review and strict offline/denied-resource test cases for WeasyPrint, then a threat-modelled executor and bounded subprocess with no sensitive mounts. No institutional documents in tests.

## ALT-02 plan — denied-resource regression (2026-11-06)

**Scope before implementation:** Extend only the CI-only WeasyPrint probe `server/tests/p1kWeasyPrintAlternative.py` with deterministic negative fixtures; no changes to report routes, templates, Chromium, PDFKit, application dependencies, authorization, or deployment configuration.

1. Exercise a temporary synthetic local `file://` secret and a loopback `http://127.0.0.1` URL through CSS/HTML resource resolution. Use the same explicit rejecting URL fetcher as ALT-01 and verify that every configured denial is actually invoked (avoid passing simply because no resource was requested).
2. Verify rendered test PDF is structurally recognizable and does not contain synthetic sentinel text; preserve the existing 85/38 order checks.
3. Run available local syntax and functional checks, then confirm the existing CI job executes the new negative probe and succeeds. Inspect exact logs; document failures and fixes.
4. Report the narrow result truthfully: interception of WeasyPrint URL fetches is not proof of complete OS sandboxing, filesystem syscall denial, blocked network sockets, or production readiness. Memory/CPU/time/total disk caps, full visual comparison, dependency security and institutional host remain future gates.

**Acceptance:** test explicitly observes both denied fetch attempts, no sentinel disclosure and no regression in previous synthetic continuity, with passing relevant CI evidence. If CI fails or logs cannot be checked, mark ALT-02 pending rather than complete. **Release gate unchanged:** HTTP 503.
